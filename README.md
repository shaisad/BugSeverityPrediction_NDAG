## Overview:
This project focuses on utilizing deep learning technique: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, to predict the severity of software bugs. The severity levels are categorized into seven classes: 'normal', 'enhancement', 'major', 'minor', 'critical', 'blocker', and 'trivial'. The primary objective is to develop a predictive model capable of accurately classifying bug reports into these severity levels based on their textual descriptions.

## Project Implementation:

The implementation of the project was done in Google Colab. Link to the Colab notebook: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1za1-G45fCtCfpNRaYVrHSdx3urU8HpUY?usp=sharing
<br><br>We visualized the data, preprocessed the data, trained LSTM model on it and found a training accuracy of 0.7708 and validation accuracy of 0.6681.<br> <br>
